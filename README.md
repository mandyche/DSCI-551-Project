# DSCI-551-Project
 Tech stack used for implementation:
 This project uses Python for backend logic, Flask for the web interface, MySQL for database
 management, and NLP libraries (nltk) for parsing and converting natural language into SQL
 queries.
 
 Plan to implement query syntax:
 It will be generated through Python functions that map user input to SQL constructs. The system
 will also interpret natural language queries, translating the information into SQL commands
 based on the templates I created.
 
 Databases chose to use:
 So far, I decided to choose the Chinook database for my test dataset. Chinook database is a
 sample database that represents a digital music store, containing tables for customers, invoices,
 artists, etc. It is well-suited for testing SQL queries as JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc. It is
 not finally decided if anything will be changed later on during the work progress.
